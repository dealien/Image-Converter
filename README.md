# Image Converter

This is a Python project designed to streamline my everyday workflow for basic image manipulation. It also serves as a good test for Google's AI code generation tools like Gemini and Jules.

All images were generated by Google's Gemini service for testing purposes.

## Features

- **Ordered, Chained Manipulations:** Apply multiple manipulations to an image in a single command. The operations are executed in the order they are specified.
- **Remove Background:** Automatically removes the background from an image.
- **Scale Image:** Resizes images by a specific factor (e.g., `2x`) or to fit within given dimensions (e.g., `800px 600px`). Supports various resampling filters.
- **Image Filters:** Apply common image filters like color inversion and grayscale.
- **Flip Image:** Flip images horizontally, vertically, or both.
- **Batch Processing:** Apply any of the above manipulations to a single image or to all images within a directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dealien/Image-Converter.git
   cd image-converter
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To process an image, run the `main.py` script with the desired options.

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py [file_path] [options]
```

- `[file_path]`: Path to the input image file. You can use wildcards (`*`) to process multiple files. If no file is specified, the script will process all images in the `Base Images/` directory.

### Options

- `-bg, --remove-background`: Remove the background from the image.
- `-s, --scale [value]`: Scale the image.
  - By factor: `1.5x`
  - By dimensions: `400px 300px`
- `--resample [filter]`: Resampling filter for scaling. Choices: `nearest`, `bilinear`, `bicubic`, `lanczos` (default: `bilinear`).
- `-i, --invert`: Invert the colors of the image.
- `-g, --grayscale`: Convert the image to grayscale.
- `--flip [direction]`: Flip the image. Choices: `horizontal`, `vertical`, `both`.

## Examples

### Remove the background of a single image
```bash
python main.py "path/to/your/image.jpg" --remove-background
```

### Scale all PNG images in a directory to 50%
```bash
python main.py "path/to/your/images/*.png" --scale 0.5x
```

### Chaining Multiple Operations
The true power of this tool lies in its ability to chain multiple operations. The manipulations are applied sequentially in the order you provide them.

For example, to take an image, invert its colors, flip it vertically, convert it to grayscale, remove the background, and then invert the colors *again*, you can run:
```bash
python main.py "image.jpg" --invert --flip vertical --grayscale --remove-background --invert
```

This command executes the five operations in sequence, starting with the original `image.jpg` and passing the result of each step to the next.

### Process all images in the `Base Images` directory
This will first remove the background and then scale the images to fit within 800x600 pixels. The order of operations matters.
```bash
python main.py * --remove-background --scale 800px 600px
```
