# Image Converter

This is a Python project designed to streamline my everyday workflow for basic image manipulation. It also serves as a good test for Google's AI code generation tools like Gemini and Jules.

All images were generated by Google's Gemini service for testing purposes.

## Features

- **Remove Background:** Automatically removes the background from an image.
- **Scale Image:** Resizes images by a specific factor (e.g., `2x`) or to fit within given dimensions (e.g., `800px 600px`). Supports various resampling filters.
- **Image Filters:** Apply common image filters like color inversion and grayscale.
- **Flip Image:** Flip images horizontally, vertically, or both.
- **Batch Processing:** Apply any of the above manipulations to a single image or to all images within a directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/image-converter.git
   cd image-converter
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To process an image, run the `main.py` script with the desired options.

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py [file_path] [options]
```

- `[file_path]`: Path to the input image file. You can use wildcards (`*`) to process multiple files. If no file is specified, the script will process all images in the `Base Images/` directory.

### Options

- `-bg, --remove-background`: Remove the background from the image.
- `-s, --scale [value]`: Scale the image.
  - By factor: `1.5x`
  - By dimensions: `400px 300px`
- `--resample [filter]`: Resampling filter for scaling. Choices: `nearest`, `bilinear`, `bicubic`, `lanczos` (default: `bilinear`).
- `-i, --invert`: Invert the colors of the image.
- `-g, --grayscale`: Convert the image to grayscale.
- `--flip [direction]`: Flip the image. Choices: `horizontal`, `vertical`, `both`.

## Examples

### Remove the background of a single image
```bash
python main.py "path/to/your/image.jpg" -bg
```

### Scale all PNG images in a directory to 50%
```bash
python main.py "path/to/your/images/*.png" -s 0.5x
```

### Convert an image to grayscale and flip it vertically
```bash
python main.py "image.png" -g --flip vertical
```

### Process all images in the `Base Images` directory
This will remove the background and scale them to fit within 800x600 pixels.
```bash
python main.py -bg -s 800px 600px
```
